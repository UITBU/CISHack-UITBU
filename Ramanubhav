Description :
				We intend to develop a web portal as a Patient Centered Information Exchange System for Hospitals
				which will allow them to easily upload various information related to patients which only the
				patient can access and view at any time.
				It will reduce the need of the patient to visit the Hospital every time to get an update. It will
				act as an effective way of communication between the Healthcare providers and the Patients. It 
				will maintain the privacy of the individuals as  the information shared can only be viewed by 
				the parties directly involved.
