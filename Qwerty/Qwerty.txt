4. Articles about common healthcare problems and their remedies


Future scope:

Tech Stack: 


Java, Android application and Artificial intelligence


Positive and unique solutions of our idea:


1. Online + Offline- “Life” not only lets users book online appointments over video or chat-based system but also lets users find doctors in their city and book offline appointments through its user-friendly intuitive user interface
 
2. Physical + mental- Other apps in the market only focus on contacting doctors relating to physical pain but “Life” also puts emphasis on mental health wherein users can also book appointments with psychologists and therapists.


3. Awareness- “Life” provides users with articles on various health related issues to keep them regularly updated with what’s trending in the health department and ways to healthy lifestyle.


4. Medical forms- “Life” uniquely brings doctors of different alternative medicine systems such as Allopathy, Homeopathy, Ayurveda etc., so that users have the option to pick their form of medicine.
